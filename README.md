# Todo App ✅

このアプリは、React（TypeScript）を使って作成したToDoリストです。  
未経験からエンジニアを目指している中で、基礎技術や状態管理の理解を深めるために作成しました。

## 📝 主な機能
- タスクの追加・削除・編集
- チェックボックスでの 完了・未完了 の管理

## 💡 学習目的・工夫した点
- JavaScriptの基礎を復習しつつ、教材を参考にしながらTypeScriptの型定義の理解を深めることを目的に取り組みました。
- コンポーネントの分割や状態管理（useState等）を意識して実装しました。
- GitHub Pagesを用いたデプロイも経験し、公開までの流れを学習しました。
- 今後は、より自分のアイデアを反映させたアプリの自作に挑戦していきます。

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
